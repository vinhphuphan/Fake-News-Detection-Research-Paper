Explanation:
Quantum tunneling is not the mechanism that allows superfluids to flow through solid walls. Instead, it is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that allows particles to pass through potential barriers, such as a thin insulating layer, that they would not be able to pass through classically. The mechanism that allows superfluids to flow through solid walls is called the London penetration depth.
